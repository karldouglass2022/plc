  "learningGoals": [
    "Use shapes and lines to build images",
    "Edit paths/nodes to refine designs",
    "Organise work using layers and grouping",
    "Choose colours, fonts and alignment with purpose",
    "Export graphics for different uses (web/print)"

  "mastery": [
    "Create a logo/icon that meets a brief",
    "Apply consistent colour + typography choices",
    "Demonstrate clean layering and alignment",
